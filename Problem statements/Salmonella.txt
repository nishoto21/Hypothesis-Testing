Salmonella  disease
 
An outbreak of Salmonella - related illness was attributed to ice cream produced at a certain ice cream factory.Scientists measured the level of Salmonella in 9 randomly sampled batches of ice cream.The levels (in MPN/g) were:

0.593, 0.142, 0.329, 0.691, 0.231, 0.793, 0.519, 0.392, 0.418

Is there evidence that the mean of Salmonella in the ice cream is greater than 0.3 MPN/g?
