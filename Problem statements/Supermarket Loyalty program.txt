SuperMarket loyalty program:


A supermarket plans to launch a loyalty program if it results in an average spending per shopper of more than $120 per week.

A random sample of 80 shoppers enrolled in the pilot program spent an average of $130 with a standard deviation of $40.

Should the loyalty program be launched?
